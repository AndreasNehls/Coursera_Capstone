### Opening of new bakeries

#### Introduction / Business problem
Feine Schnitte is a freshly baked start-up company (bakery) from Berlin (Germany) that wants to open its first stores. Their speciality is the locally produced vegan products.

In this report we will analyse the individual distribution of the Bakckshops and whether there is a connection between the individual districts. With the help of this report, we identify possible locations for the new stores of Feine Schnitte. This map should also serve to define new locations in the event of a possible further expansion.

#### Data
Description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem. To answer this question, we analyze the Foursquare locations of the Berlin bakeries. We will use the Foursquare API to display the geographic coordinates on a map to see if some areas have a much higher number of bakeries.
