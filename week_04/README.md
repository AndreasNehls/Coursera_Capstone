### Opening of new bakery shops

1. introduction / business problem

Feine Schnitte is a freshly baked start-up company (bakery) from Berlin (Germany) who want to open their first shops. Their special feature are the locally produced vegan products.

In this report we will analyze how the individual distribution of the Bakckshops looks like and whether there is a connection between the individual districts. With the help of this report we show possible locations for the new shops of Feine Schnitte. This map should also serve to define new locations in the event of a possible further expansion.

2. data

Description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem.
To answer this question, we will analyze the Foursquare locations of the Berlin bakeries. We will use the Foursquare API to display the geographical coordinates on a map to see if some areas have a much higher number of bakeries.
